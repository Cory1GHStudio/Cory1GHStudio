### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cory! I'm new to this world of technology but quickily developing a love for all things development.
I'm currently learning... the basics! This is a new journey for me < 1 year so bare with me; I have big plans though!
Looking to share some portfolio projects and work with other developers to gain a better understanding of complex Game Development.
Feel free to reach out to me on my linkedin profile. Link in profile.
